# M6-Generative-Art

## Modified 10Print
10PrintModified.js modifies the original pattern by making each diagonal line a random color. This was done by first segmenting each diagonal line into a subpath using the context.beginPath() method and setting each line to a random RGB value.

## Modified Molnar
molnarModified.js modifies the original pattern to create a violet gradient from top to bottom.
It does so by increasing the rbg values from a specified base to a specified maximum color every layer.
